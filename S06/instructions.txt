Objective:
Walk through step by step on how CloudWatch Log works for monitoring log files.
For production use, you should CloudWatch Log Agent that automatically monitors the log files
for new entries and publishes them to CloudWatch Log Service.

This also shows how you can publish events from your own personal computer (or servers outside of AWS) to CloudWatch Log.

Steps:
a. Create Log Group 'CountLogEvents'
b. Create Log Stream 'Stream1'
c. Publish messages from file 'Demo-CWLog-Data-1.txt' (ensure time stamps in the file is updated to current time)
d. Add metric filter to count events
e. Publish messages from file 'Demo-CWLog-Data-2.txt' (ensure time stamps in the file is updated to current time)
f. Add metric filter to capture errors
g. Publish messages with errors from file 'Demo-CWLog-Data-3.txt' (ensure time stamps in the file is updated to current time)

Command to create Log Stream:
aws logs create-log-stream --log-group-name CountLogEvents --log-stream-name Stream1 --profile myadmin

Command to publish events:
aws logs put-log-events --profile myadmin --log-group-name CountLogEvents --log-stream-name Stream1 --log-events file://CWLog-Data-3.txt --sequence-token 49559370658318598132673133504720164004297095686664494802
